### Description of project
This small project looks at using functions and TDD.
We're also implementing Agile and Scrum principles.

Topics covered include:
- Functions
- TDD
- Documentation
- Agile
- Scrum

### Functions
Functions are like people at work. They have ONE JOB!
This makes it easier to test.

### How do they work?
1) We need to define them.
2) Then call them.
3) They run the block that is intended.

Other functionality:
- They can take in arguments to be dynamic of morph the output

If a variable is like a box, you name it and place things inside. The box does NOT interact with your stuff. For example, if you name a box "Books" and place some potatoes inside, you do not get french fries.

### Why functions?
Because it keeps your code DRY:
- Don't
- Repeat
- Yourself

Allowing us to call said function to do the actions in block.

### Best practices of function
- Name conventions in python is like a variable, lower_case_underscore()
- IT DOES ONE JOB! ONE!
- Separation of concerns principle 
    - single point of failure in code,
    - Makes code more maintainable
    
## Basis of test
A test has known or controlled inputs and expect outputs.
All it is, is an assertion.

You give it a known input, and you assert

### Intallation and how to run
